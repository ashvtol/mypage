1. <u>Online Journal</u><br><br>
A secret diary or a private journal of ideas, notes and pictures that could be
accessible from anywhere. The main motivation was secrecy, maintaining a diary
in the hostel was tough because friends visited the rooms day in and day out
and in such a scenario maintaining a secret diary was almost impossible.So we
made an online journal where in every user would get a private space toexpress
their feelings freely. We introduced themes so that users could add pictures,
personalize their private space according to their moods and very importantly
we encrypted their data. This project was based on Database Management System
