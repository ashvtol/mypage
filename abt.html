Presently I&#39m pursuing Computer Science Engineering in National Institute of Technology,
Rourkela. I was born in Bihar and brought up in Hyderabad which is now in the state of Telangana. There are various
reasons why I find this research interesting.
<br>
<p>
  First of all I like to question things a lot, I do my own research in many ways before making a point.
  For example the &#34BIG BEN&#34 one of the greatest still-functional monument of Britain, I wondered whom it was named
  after and why they called it big ben, so after little googling and reading articles I knew that big ben is not
  the name of the monument but it&#39s actually &#34THE ELIZABETH TOWER&#34 and people have a misconception that the
  bell inside the tower is called BIG BEN but no, it&#39s officially called &#34THE GREAT BELL&#34, so what exactly
  is BIG BEN, well the &#34THE GREAT BELL&#34 was nicked as BIG BEN.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from this, I also like to program and code. My main ares of interest in academic are Data Science,
  Operating Systems, Algorithm and Design. I like tinkering with my Linux server, playing console games,
  expanding my steadily growing music collection. I&#39m good at photoshop so i design posters and wallpapers
  in my free time.
